Synth Circuits by J3RK (Dustin Stroh / Stroh Modular)

Please feel free to use these files, designs, parts of the designs, etc. to build your own circuits, synths, modules, PCBs, etc.  
I would ask that if you're going to make a retail project (beyond DIY PCBs) that you get in touch with me.  This isn't something that I mind, but would like the chance to discuss it first.  I can be reached via PM at www.modwiggler.com as J3RK.  From there I can give you my email address.  

One of the main reasons for this, is that there are a few circuit portions in some of these that were used with permission from other designers.  For example the Operator sawtooth core is my version of Ian Fritz' version of Terry Michaels' sawtooth.  I received permission to use the basic core for this.  The phase modulator is also a Bernie Hutchins circuit (well part of it) that I also received permission to use.  There are others as well, but if any of these were going into a commercial project, I would want to get further permission where possible.

Most designs here are different enough from existing like functions though.  For exmaple the Angle Generators were completely designed from scratch by myself and a relative, so I'm happy to share. (despite the functionality resembling the Serge USG or Buchla 281) 

Note: These schematics will contain specific op amps that may or may not be recommended, required, or just there because that's how I laid out the schematic.  90%+ can be swapped out for your favorite TL07x type, or something fancier.  There are a few that are more or less required, and I will be adding both notes, and notes inside the BOMs with my recommendations for this.  (for example, the Line Out module has OPA2604 in the schematic.  I prefer LME49720, but you could use anything for this circuit)

Update - 10/11/2023
More files have been updated, and there will be more panel FPD files uploaded soon.  More options for panel widths for various builds, etc.  There will be some completely new designs up soon as well.  They're progressing slowly due to the build backlog, but they're getting there.  :)

Update - 6/7/2023
More schematics and BOMs have been uploaded.  More on the way soon.

Note: The "Foldy" wave folder simulates perfectly, but hasn't been tested yet.  Still laying out the PCB.  Should work fine, but may need some minor tweaks in the feedback paths of the folder block.

Note: SREDDAL FILTER has not been tested yet.  The main filter block has been on a separate design, but the new voltage control for resonance and VCA section has been newly added.

Added some 3" Panel files for some of the recent modules.

More items on the way soon.

Final version of the Transform Crossfader/Panner/DualVCA/Mixer is now up.  Currently working on getting more panels up to date to match these projects.

Uploaded Panel Files for all current projects.  All panels are correct. 6-28-2023

More Schematics and BOMs uploaded.  I'll have the panels up for the new ones shortly.
