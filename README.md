Synth Circuits by J3RK (Dustin Stroh / Stroh Modular)

Please feel free to use these files, designs, parts of the designs, etc. to build your own circuits, synths, modules, PCBs, etc.  
I would ask that if you're going to make a retail project (beyond DIY PCBs) that you get in touch with me.  This isn't something that I mind, but would like the chance to discuss it first.  I can be reached via PM at www.modwiggler.com as J3RK.  From there I can give you my email address.

Note: These schematics will contain specific op amps that may or may not be recommended, required, or just there because that's how I laid out the schematic.  90%+ can be swapped out for your favorite TL07x type, or something fancier.  There are a few that are more or less required, and I will be adding both notes, and notes inside the BOMs with my recommendations for this.  (for example, the Line Out module has OPA2604 in the schematic.  I prefer LME49720, but you could use anything for this circuit)

Update - 6/7/2023
More schematics and BOMs have been uploaded.  More on the way soon.

Note: The "Foldy" wave folder simulates perfectly, but hasn't been tested yet.  Still laying out the PCB.  Should work fine, but may need some minor tweaks in the feedback paths of the folder block.
