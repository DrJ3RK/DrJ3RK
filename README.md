Synth Circuits by J3RK (Dustin Stroh / Stroh Modular)

Please feel free to use these files, designs, parts of the designs, etc. to build your own circuits, synths, modules, PCBs, etc.  
I would ask that if you're going to make a retail project (beyond DIY PCBs) that you get in touch with me.  This isn't something that I mind, but would like the chance to discuss it first.  I can be reached via PM at www.modwiggler.com as J3RK.  From there I can give you my email address.

Note: These schematics will contain specific op amps that may or may not be recommended, required, or just there because that's how I laid out the schematic.  90%+ can be swapped out for your favorite TL07x type, or something fancier.  There are a few that are more or less required, and I will be adding both notes, and notes inside the BOMs with my recommendations for this.  (for example, the Line Out module has OPA2604 in the schematic.  I prefer LME49720, but you could use anything for this circuit)

Update: 03/30/2023:
I have removed most of the current files.  I am in the process of updating everything to the latest revisions, which includes new schematics, and new (proper) BOMs that are easier to read, contain proper notes, etc.  I am also annotating important items on the schematics now, which tend to generate questions.  

There are still a few of the older ones, but I intend to replace EVERYTHING.  

I'm including revision numbers in the docs now, to make it easier to track with the PCB revision.  If you have a PCB revision that is not contained here, feel free to contact me via the usual methods, and I can provide the correct version for your PCB.

The first fully updated project to be uploaded is the Neo VCO Core.  This is used for UtilOSC, VCO++ and possible future VCO projects.  It includes the new style of schematic and BOM if you'd like to check out what everything will look like going forward.  

More updates to follow.
