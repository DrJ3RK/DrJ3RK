Synth Circuits by J3RK (Dustin Stroh / Stroh Modular)

Please feel free to use these files, designs, parts of the designs, etc. to build your own circuits, synths, modules, PCBs, etc.  
I would ask that if you're going to make a retail project (beyond DIY PCBs) that you get in touch with me.  This isn't something that I mind, but would like the chance to discuss it first.  I can be reached via PM at www.modwiggler.com as J3RK.  From there I can give you my email address.

Note: These schematics will contain specific op amps that may or may not be recommended, required, or just there because that's how I laid out the schematic.  90%+ can be swapped out for your favorite TL07x type, or something fancier.  There are a few that are more or less required, and I will be adding both notes, and notes inside the BOMs with my recommendations for this.  (for example, the Line Out module has OPA2604 in the schematic.  I prefer LME49720, but you could use anything for this circuit)

UPDATE: 4/19/22

I've started working on these and other designs again.  Several of the ones that are up here, after some testing, needed some updates.  I'll be getting the files updated, adding new notes, then getting the latest new designs up.  I've done some extensive building and testing over the last few weeks, laid out new panels, ordered more PCBs, etc.  There will be a steady stream of updates very soon.  

UPDATE: 4/26/22

I've uploaded updated versions of schematics, new BOMs, notes, and other files.  I've removed some that were superceded or problematic, and will be replacing them with new ones that do not have issues.

More panel FPDs have been uploaded.

More files on the way soon!

UPDATE: 4/27/22
The UtilOSC docs are kind of a special case.  The schematic and BOM are accurate.  I have a stack of boards.  I do not have the board layout any longer.  I accidentally deleted it with no backup to recover.  I had to reverse engineer the PCB with a meter, and pull part values from my other 2131 designs.  I'll need to lay out a completely new board going forward.  However, for those that want to build their own, the schematic and BOM is accurate and tested on physical PCBs.
