VC Angle Note

The 1.8 schematic for the VC Angle circuit is compatible with previous versions of the PCBs.
It contains component value changes that increase performance, stability, and reliability.
The changes reduce parasitic oscillation in the integrator among other things.

R19 and R21 can be adjusted a bit to dial in the limits of the of the slope ranges.

C1 should be as small as possible while still giving the timing range desired.
C12 is for slower speed, but should follow the same guidelines as C1.  (as low as possible while still performing as needed)

Take care not to make solder bridges to or from the guard ring around the integrator components as it is unmasked.

I don't always make use of the OR mixer, but I should have probably included an LED driver for it.  Maybe in a newer revision later on.

In the meantime, if you want LED indication on the OR output, simply add an LED from the junction of Pin 14 (of U9) and R45/R47, with 
a series resistor of around 680R to ground.  It will not have any negative impacts.
