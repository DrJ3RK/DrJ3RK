Note:  FlexWave VCO 1.2 and 1.3

I have noticed on two builds (but not on all the others (I've built many)) that
the LED driver on the primary oscillator can occasionally cause some odd behavior.
It doesn't usually happen on the mod oscillator, bit is techincally possible.

It may be related to current draw, and there are a couple of ways to mitigate or
eliminate the issues, if your board shows this behavior. 

What you'll notice, if this is happening, is an oddly shaped triangle wave, or a
mishapen sine wave.

If you see this there are two possible methods to resolve it.  

Increase the value of the resistor feeding the LED driver op amp.

This is R34 (Primary) and R120 (Mod Oscillator)

Try increasing to 2.2K or possibly even a bit higher like 3K-3.3K

If you're still getting this issue:

Lift the entry side of R34 (or R120 on the mod side).  Run jumper to another
output, like 4Q multiplier output, shaped out, triangle out, etc.
