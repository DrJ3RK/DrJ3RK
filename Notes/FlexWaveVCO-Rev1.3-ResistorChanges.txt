R68 - 24.3K (Adjusts CV Range for Wave Fader)
R70 - 27K (Adjusts CV Range for Wave Fader)
R50 - 6.8K (Lowers level sent from Fader to 4Q Multiplier Input)
R40 - 110K (optional, just PWM CV Range)
R41 - 220K (optional, just PWM Knob Range)
R13 - 820R (required for 12V operation, 1K for 15V)
R27 - 60.4K (more amplitude for Sine Wave on 12V power)
R117 - 60.4K (more amplitude for Sine Wave on 12V power)
R34 - May need adjustment depending on behavior of Main Oscillator's Sine Output.  This LED driver has potential to cut the output a bit. (or cut trace and connect to buffered triangle output)
